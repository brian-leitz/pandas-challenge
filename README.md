Using pandas to create a report and analyze school test results data


This data includes results from math and reading standardized testing results within our school district as well as information on each school. This includes data from 15 high schools across our district and data from over 39,000 students, we would like to illustrate and visualize the trends in our students standardized testing results. Our initial analysis analyzed our district’s data at a snapshot, showing how all schools and students combined are performing. The data shows that our students are currently performing at an average to below average level for the most part with the passing rate for Math testing, along with the overall passing rate for math and reading being particularly concerning. 

What is also particularly concerning is the lack of correlation between schools that have higher spending budgets and schools that are showing high average testing scores in math & reading. Schools like Pena High School that has the second to lowest budget among all schools have average math & reading testing scores of roughly 84 compared to Bailey high school spending over 3 million dollars per year, with average scores of 77 in math and 81 in reading. 

High Schools with a large number of students and a large budget like Johnson High School, Rodriguez High School and Bailey high school have among the worst overall passing rates within the district, being in the bottom five in overall passing rates for math and reading among all schools. This could be due to just the sheer size of each school slightly skewing the final piece of data, however this is still very concerning and further analysis should be done on the budgets for each of these schools to make sure resources are being properly utilized and testing as well as our students’ success rate remains among the top priority in schools. 

In conclusion, there is a clear correlation between schools with a smaller amount of students, a smaller budget meaning less to invest in each student, having higher testing rates versus schools with a higher budget and more students having lower testing rates. We need to perform further analysis to determine why this worrying trend is showing in our districts testing results and what can be done to help these low performing schools.
